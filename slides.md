### What is this talk about?

* We're not gonna talk about your average custom mechanical keyboard
* We're gonna talk about small from factor (sub 40%), ergonomic, low profile (choc), open-source(mostly), mechanical keyboards
* We're gonna talk about what firmware/software features/techniques make them a viable option (features that can be applied even to normal keyboards)
* ... and, above all, **why** should you want to try them.
